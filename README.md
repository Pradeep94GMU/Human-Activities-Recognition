# Human-Activities-Recognition
Human Activities Recognition
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to recognize various human activities with high accuracy. The model has been trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset, achieving an impressive 93% accuracy.

Project Overview
Human activity recognition (HAR) is a key area of research in machine learning and computer vision. This project focuses on identifying and classifying different human activities based on sensor data. The activities recognized in this project include but are not limited to:

Walking
Running
Sitting
Standing
Sweeping
Lifting Weights
Typing
Drinking
Climbing Stairs (Up/Down)
Riding Elevators (Up/Down)
Body Rotating
Waving
Sweeping
Files and Folders
The repository is organized into folders representing each activity. The main script used for training and testing the model can be found in the all python code folder.

Key Features
Machine Learning Model: Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the model is trained on a rich dataset with various activities. The data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training scripts are available in the all python code folder.
Accuracy: The final model achieves 93% accuracy in correctly classifying human activities.
Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-Learn
